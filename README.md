# exponential-notes

The aim was to build this single page notes app using self rendering components, similar to React. 
However, we were restricted to using vanilla javascript without any third party framework, which meant we had to create our own test suite in order to test drive the development.

### App set up
- Clone this repo and move into the project directory.
#### To run the tests
```
$ open spec/TestRunner.html
```
#### To start the app
```
$ open index.html
```
